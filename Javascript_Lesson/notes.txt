Introduction
==============
- Javascript is an interpreted language - it does not need to be compiled
- Multiparadigm - meaning, you can write your code in different ways
- to initiate a an index file, type ! followed by the tab key. 
- install the live server extension in VSCode to be able to visualize your work
- once the live server is installed, open your index with live server
- test : you can type <h1>Hello World<h1> in the body section and you can viusalize it on your live server
- to add a java script element, you can add it in either the head section or the body section. It is recommended to add it in the end of the body section


Separation of Concerns
======================
- separating our html (content) from our javascript (behaviour - how the webpage behave)
- we created another file called index.js and saved our scripts inside.
- we then referenced the name of the as the source "src" script in <script><script>


Running our js script using node
================================
- Following the installation of Node, open your command prompt if windows and locate your index.js file
- execute "node index.js"


Variables
===========
- used to store data temporarily in our computer's memory
- define a variable using the following syntax : let <name of your var> = "value of yoru variable";
- let allows you to create a variable but can be changed later on
- Best practices when naming a var:
    - can't be a js keywork like let, if
    - must be meaningful
    - can't start with a number
    - they are case sensitive
    - use camelCase notation
    - cannot contain space or hyphen
    - define each variable on a separate line


Constants
==========
- Constant is used to create a variable that will not change in the future
- constant cannot be reassigned
- constant should be your default choice
- Two types of values can be assigned to a variable
    - Primitive and reference type


Primitive Types
===============
- this includes :
    - string - text
    - number - integer/float/decimal (1,2,3,4.5, 0.2.....). 
    - Boolean - true /false
    - undefined -- type is also undefined
    - null - used when we want to clear the value of a variable 
    - symbol -- not very common


Referenece Types
=================
- this includes :
    - objects
    - arrays
    - function

Object 
======
- insetad of decalring 2 variables, you can declare and object.
- you can define an object using the object literal {} see line 18-21 in index.js
- object is a key value pair


Arrays 
=======
- this is used for declaring or storing a list
- an array literal is [] and it is an empty array - until populated with items
- an array can contain different types of elements from string to numbers or a combination of types
- you can use the .push property of an arrayed variable to add to its array (at the end of the list)
- you can use the .unshift property of an arrayed variable to add to its array at the beginning
- 

Functions
==========
- set of statements that perform a task
- use the "function" keyword to define a function - see line 36 of the index.js
- Types of functions are :
    - 



Dynamic Typing
===============

- Java script is a dynamic language as the value of a variabvle can change
- All numbers are numbers - no floating or integer
